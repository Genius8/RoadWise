# 3D Defensive Driving Training Simulation

A realistic 3D defensive driving training simulation built in **Unity**, designed to replicate a self-paced defensive driving course.

## Features

- **Distraction Scenarios & Monitoring**  
  Implemented driver distraction scenarios and reaction-time monitoring to simulate real-world driving challenges.

- **Obstacle & Environmental Behaviors**  
  Created dynamic obstacles and simulated various weather and visibility conditions for a realistic training environment.

- **Vehicle & Interaction Systems**  
  Developed vehicle physics and interaction mechanics using C# scripting, Rigidbody physics, colliders/triggers, and raycasting.

- **Responsive Controls & Dynamic Camera**  
  Integrated Unity Input System and Cinemachine to provide responsive vehicle controls and smooth, dynamic camera behavior.

- **UI Feedback & Training Guidance**  
  Built UI systems that deliver real-time performance indicators and actionable training guidance to users.

## Techniques & Tools

- **Unity Systems:** Rigidbody physics, colliders, triggers, raycasting, Animator state machines, ScriptableObjects  
- **UI & Input:** UI event handling, Unity Input System, Cinemachine  
- **Other Tools:** Physics materials, C# scripting
